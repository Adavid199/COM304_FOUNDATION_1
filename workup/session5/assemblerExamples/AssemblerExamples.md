# Assembler examples

Copy each of these examples into CPULator set to ARM-7

VGA Example - illustrates displaying multiple images to the VGA [vga-example.s](../assemblerExamples/code/vga-example.s)

This example illustrates writing pictures to the VGA adaptor. 
Not that the 3 pictures are encoded as Hex words at the bottom of the assembler code.
The original source for this example is https://github.com/Tapendra-195/Armv7/tree/main

Write-jtag-uart - illustrates sending strings to the uart [write-jtag-uart.s](../assemblerExamples/code/write-jtag-uart.s)

This example illustrates sending string to the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) which is often used to drive modems.
 
THe original source for this example came from David Brown https://bohr.wlu.ca/cp216/labs/lab08InputOutput.php#Topicss
