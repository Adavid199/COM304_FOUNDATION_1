vnc with tight vnc on pi
https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=176408
So I did an update today on my Pi 3 running Raspbian. 
Now when I try to connect to it using VNC from my PC, the VNC viewer goes "No matching security types". 
That's with RealVNC. I get the same error when running vncviewer in Solaris 10. 
If I try TightVNC on the PC, I get "No security types supported". 
Oddly enough, the VNC Viewer app for Android works fine

From there I opened the VNC server window. From there I went to the Options menu, 
set Authentication to "VNC password" and Encryption to "Prefer off". I then clicked OK and that was that. I can now log into the Pi using RealVNC and TightVNC from my PC's again.

Thank you, Jobutex, for the kind words about my book. It's being used in the classroom for the first time this semester at Sonoma State University and Santa Rosa Jr. College. I'm sure there will be changes as I receive feedback from the students. :-) And I would very much like to hear comments from any readers, especially errors or suggested improvements. I maintain a log of changes under the "Errata" tab on my main web page.

Note that the last chapter is an assembly language introduction to programming the GPIO. The intent of my explanation is to help the reader to understand how to read the Broadcom datasheet, and the reasons for using /dev/mem and the mmap function. I think this chapter would be useful even for those who will be programming the GPIO in higher level languages.

REally good https://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/armTutorial/index.html   This reader introduces the basics of ARM v7 assembly. The primary goal is to help students who already know how to program in a high level language learn about the form their programs take after compiling - the kinds of instructions a computer really processes information. These materials provide examples of basic ARM instructions, assembly programming constructs, and how high level languages constructs are represented in assembly.

Logisim does not model gate delays. Logisim is not appropriate for this kind of simulation which requires gate delays to provide the expected results. For some circuits you may get what you expected, out of luck, due to the order the software evaluate the logic level changes.
