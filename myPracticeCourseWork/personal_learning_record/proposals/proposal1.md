# Council Proposal 1

## Explanation of this proposal
*What do you think this proposal might mean? How might it be implemented?*

To replace all fixed office PCs with a hot desk solution, enabling flexible workspace usage, reducing costs, and improving employee mobility while aligning with modern workplace trends.The current office setup assigns each employee a dedicated PC and workstation. While this model has historically provided stability, it now presents several challenges.Limited flexibility Employees are tied to a single desk, reducing opportunities for collaboration and agile working.High costs Maintaining individual PCs increases hardware, licensing, and IT support expenses.
.Mismatch with hybrid work With many employees working remotely part-time, dedicated PCs often sit idle, wasting resources.

Pilot Program:
Launch in one department to test workflows, desk booking systems, and IT infrastructure.

Feedback Collection:
Gather employee input on usability, productivity, and satisfaction.
Adjust policies and infrastructure based on feedback.

Phased Rollout:
Expand gradually across departments, ensuring minimal disruption.

Training & Support:
Provide workshops and guides on using hot desks, logging in securely, and accessing cloud resources.

Monitoring & Evaluation:
Track usage rates, employee satisfaction, and cost savings.
Adjust desk numbers and layouts as needed.

Strategic Impact
Positions the organization as a modern, agile workplace.
Enhances employee collaboration and mobility.
Reduces long-term operational costs while improving sustainability.

Aligns with industry best practices for hybrid and flexible working.
## Technologies and research relevant to this proposal

Cloud services & virtual desktops – since hot desking requires employees to log in from any workstation, cloud-based applications and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) are essential.

Desk booking systems – software that allows staff to reserve desks in advance, ensuring availability and reducing conflicts.Authentication tools – single sign-on, smart cards, or biometric systems to make logging in at shared desks secure and efficient.

Authentication tools – single sign-on, smart cards, or biometric systems to make logging in at shared desks secure and efficient.

Collaboration platforms – tools like Microsoft Teams or Zoom that support mobility and flexible working.
