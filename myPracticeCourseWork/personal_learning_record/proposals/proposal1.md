# Council Proposal 1

## Explanation of this proposal
*What do you think this proposal might mean? How might it be implemented?*

To replace all fixed office PCs with a hot desk solution, enabling flexible workspace usage, reducing costs, and improving employee mobility while aligning with modern workplace trends.The current office setup assigns each employee a dedicated PC and workstation. While this model has historically provided stability, it now presents several challenges.Limited flexibility Employees are tied to a single desk, reducing opportunities for collaboration and agile working.High costs Maintaining individual PCs increases hardware, licensing, and IT support expenses.
.Mismatch with hybrid work With many employees working remotely part-time, dedicated PCs often sit idle, wasting resources.

Pilot Program:
Launch in one department to test workflows, desk booking systems, and IT infrastructure.

Feedback Collection:
Gather employee input on usability, productivity, and satisfaction.
Adjust policies and infrastructure based on feedback.

Phased Rollout:
Expand gradually across departments, ensuring minimal disruption.

Training & Support:
Provide workshops and guides on using hot desks, logging in securely, and accessing cloud resources.

Monitoring & Evaluation:
Track usage rates, employee satisfaction, and cost savings.
Adjust desk numbers and layouts as needed.

Strategic Impact
Positions the organization as a modern, agile workplace.
Enhances employee collaboration and mobility.
Reduces long-term operational costs while improving sustainability.

Aligns with industry best practices for hybrid and flexible working.
## Technologies and research relevant to this proposal
🔧 Technologies:
Cloud services & virtual desktops – since hot desking requires employees to log in from any workstation, cloud-based applications and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) are essential.

Desk booking systems – software that allows staff to reserve desks in advance, ensuring availability and reducing conflicts.Authentication tools – single sign-on, smart cards, or biometric systems to make logging in at shared desks secure and efficient.

Authentication tools – single sign-on, smart cards, or biometric systems to make logging in at shared desks secure and efficient.

Collaboration platforms – tools like Microsoft Teams or Zoom that support mobility and flexible working.

Cost efficiency: These technologies reduce the need for dedicated hardware and idle PCs, supporting the proposal’s aim of lowering expenses.

Space Utilization Studies: Workplace research shows that in hybrid offices, 40–60% of desks sit unused daily. Hot‑desking supported by booking systems can cut real estate needs by up to 30%.

Energy Efficiency Research: Studies highlight that reducing idle PCs and shifting workloads to cloud infrastructure lowers energy consumption and carbon footprint.

Sustainability: Lower energy use supports corporate responsibility and environmental targets.
Security: Authentication tools protect shared devices.

## Initial Analysis of the Proposal
*Use some simple analysis tools to help you think through whether the proposal is a good idea*
This section summarizes how well the proposal—replacing fixed office PCs with hot‑desking and cloud‑based desktops—aligns with the organization’s goals, identifies strengths and gaps, and highlights the key decisions needed to move forward. It draws on the page’s earlier content about technologies, research evidence, costs, security, and employee experience.

The proposal supports hybrid work, cost efficiency, and sustainability by decoupling users from physical machines and optimizing space usage.

Expected improvements in desk utilization, reduced hardware overhead, and more flexible collaboration across teams.

Success relies on reliable identity management, network capacity, and clear workplace policies.



### SWOT Analysis
*You can use html tables in markdown*
Strengths
Alignment with strategy: Supports hybrid working, cost reduction, and sustainability goals described elsewhere on the page.

Centralized control: Cloud/VDI and identity services enable consistent environments, simplified patching, and easier policy enforcement.

Space efficiency: Evidence cited on the page about underused desks translates into immediate real‑estate and utility savings.

Scalable platform: Cloud infrastructure allows capacity scaling for peak demand and phased rollouts described in the pilot plan.

Weaknesses
Dependence on network and cloud: Proposal’s success hinges on reliable WAN/ISP links and sufficient cloud sizing noted in the technical feasibility section.

User friction risks: Loss of personalization, login complexity, and “desk anxiety” from the employee experience analysis.

Upfront costs: Licensing for VDI/booking systems, identity upgrades, and change‑management investments flagged under cost considerations.

Application compatibility: Some legacy or high‑performance apps may not work smoothly in VDI as identified in risks.

Opportunities
Operational savings: Right‑sizing office footprint and retiring hardware accelerate ROI referenced in the cost/value section.

Improved collaboration: Flexible seating plus unified collaboration platforms can increase cross‑team interaction described in earlier benefits.

Sustainability gains: Lower energy use and reduced hardware lifecycle impacts support corporate ESG objectives noted on the page.

Modernization momentum: A successful pilot creates a blueprint for broader digital transformation and future services (device-as-a-service, deeper analytics).

Threats
Security and compliance lapses: Misconfigured sessions, weak endpoint hardening, or inadequate logging could expose data—concerns raised in the security section.

Performance and availability issues: Latency or session instability could harm productivity; these technical risks were highlighted in feasibility.

User resistance: Negative employee feedback or low adoption could undermine utilization targets tracked by pilot metrics.

Vendor and licensing complexity: Unexpected costs or restrictive vendor terms could erode the projected savings discussed under investments.
