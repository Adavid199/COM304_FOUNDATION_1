# Session 2

## Topics covered
*What topics were covered in this session*
Introducing Computer Architecture.
Bnary Arithmetic.
Boolean Algebra.
Binary and boolean.



## Personal Notes and research following this session
*Which class sessions and personal research refers to technology in this proposal. Link to examples.*
Basic principles for turning machine programable in turning complete so you can create or stimulate any turning machine with a turning machine,processing unit with both an arithmetic logic unit and processer registers.To control control unit that include instruction register and a programe counter,also store memory and data insructions in external mass storage input and output mechanisms.


## Exercises and results
*What exercises did you complete. What results. Screen shots and notes*T
Types of memory ON CPU and OFF CPU
Registe.
Arithemetic logic unit.
layer 1 cache.
layer 2 cache
memory managemet unit
comparing or processing memory in registers very fast
hitting caches may be a lot slower  

OFF CPU
SPARM/DRAM
Disk-HDD/SSD
Removable 
floppy /SD card / tape

Virtual Memory
virtual memory maps memory pages in chaches to real memory on disk,






## Summary of learning
*What did you learn through these exercises*
A central processing unit the brain of a computer reponsible for preccesing data and executing instructions for all other hardware components.The CPU processes all data instruction that run computer programs,from simple calculation to more complex tasks like searching and sorting.it acts as the central cordinator for all computer hradware,controlling the flow of data between input/output device memory with other component.also retrieves instruction from memory and interprets the instructions to understand what need to be done.
