# Foundation Computing Course (COM403) 2024

## Introduction

Welcome to the module tutorial material for Solent University Foundation Computing Course (COM403) 2024.

This repository is organised in three separate sections.

[sessions](../main/sessions) Course Material.
This is where the tutorials and examples for each week will be created and updated each week.
PLEASE do not change material here as it will be updated each week and you will have difficulty merging any changes with yours.
Instead COPY each session's the material into your own [myPracticeCourseWork](../main/myPracticeCourseWork) and modify it there.

[myPracticeCourseWork](../main/myPracticeCourseWork) 
This is where you should create and save your own practice projects.
Your tutor will never overlay new material here so you can check any of your own work into this folder.

[workup](../main/workup) This is where your tutor creates and updates material before publication each week. 
You are welcome to look but mostly it is not complete and wont work (yet).
Dont make your own changes here.
