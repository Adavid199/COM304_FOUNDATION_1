# Foundation Computing Course (COM403) 2024

## Introduction

Welcome to the module tutorial material for Solent University Foundation Computing Course (COM403) 2024.

Fundamentally, software development is a collaborative activity.
Event when you are working on your own project, you will be drawing on examples or foundation code written by someone else. 

Three of the most important disciplines when working individually or in teams on software projects are documentation, project management and version control.
We want to introduce to introduce you to these practices as part of the Foundation Computing module.

Git is a version control system invented by Linus Torvalds to help version control the development of the Linux Kernel.
It is very powerful and now very widely adopted in the computer industry, supplanting tools which were previously widely used such as Subversion and CVS. 
In this module you will learn some basic commands and practices to use Git effectively.

Github.com (now owned by Microsoft) provides a comprehensive free online tool for collaboratively managing software projects.
GitHub hosts online version control, issue management and project management tools. 

To use any of these tools you need to set up a personal github account. 
Your github account will be used by you for all the work you do in your university career.
It will become like a living CV of the code you have worked on.

We will use github to document your work, project manage your task and store your code for this module.

## Using this github material

Having set up your own github account, you will then `fork` this module repository which just means creating a clone of it in your own github account.

Your tutor can continue to work on their `upstream` copy of the material and you can work separately on your own copy.

If any changes are `committed` upstream by the tutor, you can `merge` those changes into your local repository and use them in your own work. 
You can also use this as a method for getting the example code onto your raspberry pi.


To make this process easier, this repository is organised in three separate sections.

[sessions](../main/sessions) Course Material.
This is where the tutorials and examples for each week will be created and updated each week.
PLEASE do not change material here as it will be updated each week and you will have difficulty merging any changes with yours.
Instead COPY each session's the material into your own [myPracticeCourseWork](../main/myPracticeCourseWork) and use and modify it from there.

[myPracticeCourseWork](../main/myPracticeCourseWork) 
This is where you should create and save your own practice projects.
Your tutor will never overlay new material here so you can commit any of your own work into this folder.
When you `commit` your changes and `push` them to github, your work in [myPracticeCourseWork](../main/myPracticeCourseWork) will be a permanent record of what you have been working on.

[workup](../main/workup) This is where your tutor creates and updates material before publication each week. 
You are welcome to look at stuf here but mostly it is not complete and wont work (yet).
Dont make your own changes here.

See [Introduction to Git](../main/introductionToGitHub.md) for more instructions on getting started with git and forking this repository.
