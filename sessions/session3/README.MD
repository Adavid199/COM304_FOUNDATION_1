# Session 3 - more architecture

Experiments with IO on your raspberry PI.

This week we have a guest lecture on using Node RED with a PI GPIO.
Follow the instructions to install Node RED in getting [Node RED to work with your PI](../session3/docs/Node-Red-Intro.md).

Then do these [Simple examples from Bob Potter](../session3/docs/Simple-Pi-NodeRed.md)
(You will need to do the Gertboard experiments after the next step)

After that, try the tutorial here on getting your [Gertboard to work with the PI and the Wiring Pi library](../session3/docs/gertboard-wiringpi-intro.md)
