# Simple Node Red Traffic Light Example PI

This example shows how to automate traffic light signals using Node RED.
(Thanks to Bob Potter for this example).

The objective of this exercise is to create a traffic light sequence using Node RED and then automate the switching on and off of traffic lights using the Raspberry PI GPIO.
The LED's must turn on and off in the following sequence:

```
1. RED
2. RED & AMBER
3. GREEN
4. AMBER
5. RED
```

## wiring

The circuit is constructed using a breadboard as illustaed in the following images
