## Github clone and merge

You should already have created your github account.

You now need to clone your forked repository on to your pc and merge it with my latest branch.

To do this, you will need to install git on your own machine. 
See [download git for windows https://git-scm.com/downloads/win](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)

Once GIT is installed, you will need to generate your own public and private keys and clone your repository.

You now need to follow the instructions in [Introduction to Github](../../../main/introductionToGitHub.md) 

. 

Check out the repo on your local PC.

Later you will also check out your repo on your Raspberry Pi

See the instructions in [Installing Raspberry PI](../session2/docs/remoteAccessSSHVNCPiConnect.md)
